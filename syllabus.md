## Land Acknowledgment

Oregon State University recognizes the impact that its land grant history had on Indigenous communities in Oregon. Through the Morrill Act of 1862, which established land grant universities in the United States, the federal government seized nearly 11 million acres of land from 250 sovereign tribal nations, with little or no compensation.

In 1868, the state legislature designated Corvallis College as Oregon’s land grant institution. Soon after, Oregon received 90,000 acres of federal lands — taken from the Klamath, Coos, Lower Umpqua, Siuslaw and Coquille people — to be sold to create an endowment supporting the growth of the new college, which would become Oregon State University.

Oregon State University in Corvallis is located within the traditional homelands of the Marys River or Ampinefu Band of Kalapuya. Following the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855, Kalapuya people were forcibly removed to reservations in Western Oregon. Today, living descendants of these people are part of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians. Indigenous people are valued, contributing members of the Oregon State community and represent multiple sovereign tribes among students, faculty, staff and alumni.

Oregon State University accepts its responsibility for understanding the continuing impact of that history on these communities. Oregon State is committed — in the spirit of self-reflection, learning, reconciliation and partnership — to ensure that this institution of higher learning will be of enduring benefit, not only to the state of Oregon, but also to the people on whose ancestral lands it is now located.

For more information, see [OSU's Land Acknowledgment](https://oregonstate.edu/land-acknowledgment).

## Description

What’s the difference between reading a book for pleasure and reading it for a class? What kinds of skills are necessary for upper-level work as an English major? What exactly is literary criticism? Pursue these questions by studying a selection of texts paired with works providing historical and critical context. Learn how to think and write like a literary critic by reading carefully, discussing these works in class, and writing analytical essays.

## Assignments

### Participation

- Participation includes:
  - attendance
  - preparation
  - contribution during class
- "Contributing" takes many forms: responding to questions, asking questions, having good one-on-one discussions, active note-taking, etc.

#### Absences

- Everyone gets **two** unexcused absences.
  - Additional unexcused absences harm your participation grade.
- Email me before the class you will miss to request an excused absence.

### Reading quizzes

- **Reading is your most important assignment.**
- Reading quizzes should be relatively easy if you complete the reading.
- Reading quizzes cannot be retaken.
- If you have an excused absence, reading quizzes can be made up.

#### Mutual accountability

The purpose of reading quizzes is to create a culture of mutual accountability for doing the reading in this class. Doing the reading is necessary to be prepared for class. Reading quizzes promote this norm. But they are also unnecessary once there is a norm of completing the reading.

So, I make you a special offer: **If everyone averages 90% or better on the first five weeks of reading quizzes, I will not assign reading quizzes in the second half of the class.** Everyone will receive an A for the reading quiz portion of your grade.

### Essays

tk

## Academic Misconduct

In this course, I expect you to uphold [OSU's Code of Student Conduct](https://intoosu.oregonstate.edu/osu-code-student-conduct), especially as it pertains to [academic misconduct](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty-info).

If I find that you have committed academic misconduct as defined in the documents above, you will fail the course.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence

[Generative Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) (GenAI) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini can be useful for learning. But they can also answer queries incorrectly, such as when they [hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)).

GenAI has also made cheating easier than ever. Specifically, submitting GenAI output as if it were your own work is **plagiarism**.

Below, I provide some examples of permitted and prohibited uses of GenAI in this class in the form of prompts. These lists are not exhaustive.

If you would like to use GenAI for work in this course and your usage is not clearly covered by either the general rule or the examples below, ask me about how you would like to use it.

#### General rule

- Uses of GenAI that help you *do your own* thinking and writing are permitted.
- Uses of GenAI that *do your thinking and writing for you* are prohibited.

#### Examples of permitted prompts

- "I don't understand why this word is in this sentence."
- "I don't understand the main idea of this paragraph. Can you say it in a different way?"
- "What is the difference between Concept X and Concept Y?"
- "I can't figure out how to transition between two sections of this essay. Here are the ways that I'm considering. Can you help me decide which one would be best?"

#### Examples of prohibited prompts

- "I didn't budget enough time to do the reading. What is this book/article/chapter about?"
- "I like this quote. Write a paper about it."
- "This essay is too hard to read. Can you rewrite the whole thing to in easier language?"
- "I can't figure out how to transition between these two sections of this essay. How should I do it?"

## Communication

- Before emailing me (or any of your professors), please check the syllabus to see if it answers your question.
- I respond to email within two business days.
  - If you have not received a response after two business days, please write me again.
- I recommend scheduling your emails to arrive early in the morning (e.g., 6 a.m.) for the fastest response.
  - [Gmail instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9214606)
  - [Outlook instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/delay-or-schedule-sending-email-messages-in-outlook-026af69f-c287-490a-a72f-6c65793744ba)
