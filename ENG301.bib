  year = {2024},
  publisher = {The University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  abstract = {"At a time of debate about the future of "English" as a discipline and the fundamental methods of literary study, few terms appear more frequently than "close reading." But what exactly is close reading, and where did it come from? Here John Guillory, author of the acclaimed Professing Criticism, takes up two puzzles. First, why did the New Critic--who supposedly made close reading central to literary study--so seldom use the term? And second, why have scholars not been better able to define close reading? Guillory treats these as intertwined puzzles. In fact, the purported fathers of close reading, he argues, weren't aiming to devise a method of reading at all. And this lack of specificity is one of close reading's greatest virtues. As our first reader says, "What is likely to attract the greatest attention and inspire the most heated debate is [Guillory's] argument that the so-called method wars have failed to appreciate how much close reading should be understood as a non-ideological technique, a practice that cannot be prescribed simply in words but that relies on the imitation and emulation that are central to education." Guillory's short book will be essential reading for all college teachers of literature. An annotated bibliography provides a guide to key documents in the history of close reading and a valuable resource for further research"--},

  publisher = {Johns Hopkins University Press},
  address = {Baltimore},
  abstract = {"The idea that there is a relation between media and time is a familiar one. It is often said that digital technologies have quickened the pace at which we consume information in the modern world. In Christina Lupton's Reading and the Making of Time in the Eighteenth Century, she looks back to the eighteenth century to demonstrate the ways in which the emerging print culture and modes of reading and writing affected the experience and understanding of time. Placing canonical works by Jane Austen, Elizabeth Inchbald, Henry Fielding, and Samuel Johnson alongside those of lesser known authors and readers, Lupton approaches books as objects that are good at attracting particular forms of attention. In contrast to the digital interfaces of our own moment and the newspapers and pamphlets read during the period, books are rarely seen as shaping or keeping modern time. However, Lupton argues that books are often put down and picked up at regular times, they are leafed through as well as read sequentially, and they are handed on as objects designed to bridge distances. In showing how discourse itself engages with these material practices, Lupton makes the case that reading is something to be studied textually as well as historically" --},
